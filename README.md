Earthquake Magnitude Prediction using Machine Learning
📖 Overview
This project focuses on predicting earthquake magnitudes using machine learning techniques. By leveraging regression models and advanced data preprocessing, we aim to create an efficient system for estimating earthquake magnitudes, contributing to disaster preparedness and response efforts.

🛠 Problem Statement
Earthquakes cause significant human and economic losses. Accurately predicting their magnitude can improve early warning systems and better inform response strategies. This project uses machine learning to move beyond traditional statistical methods, providing a robust and reliable prediction model.

🔍 Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Objective: Understand the dataset and relationships between features.
Key Features:
Magnitude: Measure of the seismic energy released.
Depth: Depth of the earthquake’s epicenter.
Latitude/Longitude: Geographic coordinates of the epicenter.
Alert: Categorized alert levels ('green', 'yellow', 'orange', 'red').
Significance: A score summarizing the earthquake's importance.
2. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values:
Imputed missing values in the alert column using Random Forest.
Removed columns with excessive missing values and low relevance.
Outlier Detection:
Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to handle extreme values.
Encoding:
Used Ordinal Encoding to convert alert levels ('green', 'yellow', etc.) into numerical values.
Feature Selection:
Retained predictive features, removing irrelevant ones.
3. Model Development
Data Split:
Divided data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
Algorithms Used:
Random Forest Regressor: Ensemble learning method combining decision trees.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: Sequentially minimizes errors for improved performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Used GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters with 5-fold cross-validation.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluated using the following metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R²)
5. Model Selection
Gradient Boosting Regressor emerged as the best-performing model with:
MAE: 0.0265
MSE: 0.0034
