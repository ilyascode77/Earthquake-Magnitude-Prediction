🌍 Project Overview
Earthquakes are unpredictable natural disasters that can have devastating impacts. This project focuses on predicting earthquake magnitudes using historical data. By analyzing patterns in the data and training regression models, it provides a foundation for better understanding and managing seismic risks.

🌟 Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and transforming features.
Data Visualization: Graphical analysis for better understanding of trends and anomalies.
Regression Models:
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score to assess model performance.
